Description: The Guzel Theme for 2022 is designed to not support the default WordPress editor, and to use it you  have to install  the classic editor plugin , but it allows you to use post-format for each post. Maybe gallery posts, music and other format-post and of course you can edit for yourself or suggest me to edit.
